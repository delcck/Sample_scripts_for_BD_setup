# Sample_scripts_for_BD_setup
This respiratory contains sample scripts for setting up Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations based on the code:
"Atomic Resolutioin Brownian Dynamics" (ARBD) at https://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/arbd.

Currently, these scripts are being uploaded to this respiratory based on a finished project. 
The various paths used in each script, thus, do not appear immediately comprehensible.

Follow-up scripts and outputs based on a small sample protein, as well as scripts for possible analyses, will be uploaded asap.
