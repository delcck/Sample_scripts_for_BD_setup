# Sample_scripts_for_BD_setup
This respiratory contains sample scripts for setting up Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations based on the code:
"Atomic Resolutioin Brownian Dynamics" (ARBD) at https://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/arbd.

Currently, these scripts are being uploaded to this respiratory based on a finished project. 
The various paths used in each script may, thus, may not appear immediately comprehensible.

Please cite our article at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35025510/ if using these scripts for your system. Thanks. = )
